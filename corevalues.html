      <h1>Core Values – IF Publication</h1>
      <p>At IF Publication, our work is guided by a set of unwavering core values. These principles shape every post, project, and interaction on our platform:</p>
    </section>

    <section class="values-list">
      <div class="value">
        <h2>1. Curiosity First</h2>
        <p>We believe that every question—no matter how simple or complex—is worth asking. Curiosity is the starting point of all knowledge, creativity, and community change.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>2. Radical Access</h2>
        <p>Knowledge should be free, inclusive, and accessible to all. We break down barriers to publishing and learning so that anyone can participate, regardless of background or credentials.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>3. Authentic Voice</h2>
        <p>We uplift real people telling real stories. Whether you’re an artist, a student, a researcher, or just thinking out loud, your perspective matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>4. Collaboration Over Competition</h2>
        <p>We reject elitism and gatekeeping. Instead, we build tools and spaces that allow people to connect, share skills, and co-create across disciplines and identities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>5. Transparency and Trust</h2>
        <p>We maintain open communication about our platform decisions, partnerships, and policies. We expect the same honesty from our contributors and community.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>6. Ethical Publishing</h2>
        <p>We commit to respecting privacy, giving proper credit, and disclosing conflicts of interest. We do not tolerate plagiarism, hate speech, or misinformation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>7. Decentralized Power</h2>
        <p>We’re not here to dictate truth—we’re here to hold space for many truths. We empower users to think critically, ask questions, and build community-driven conversations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <h2>8. Joyful Resistance</h2>
        <p>We honor art, protest, imagination, and play as powerful forms of resistance. In a world that tells us to conform, we celebrate those who choose to create.</p>
      </div>
